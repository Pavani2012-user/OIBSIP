Temperature Converter – OIBSIP Web Development Internship Project

As part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship (OIBSIP), I developed a Temperature Converter web application. This project aimed to build a user-friendly tool that allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin seamlessly. The main objective of the task was to apply the core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an interactive and responsive web-based utility.

The user interface was designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring that the layout was clean, accessible, and visually appealing. The converter features an input field for users to enter a temperature value and dropdown menus to select the source and target temperature units. The JavaScript logic handles the conversion calculations based on standard temperature conversion formulas. It listens for user input and instantly updates the result based on the selected units, offering a smooth user experience.

One of the key aspects of this project was validating user input to ensure accurate conversions and handling edge cases such as negative values or empty input fields. The application also includes error messages and result formatting for better usability. The responsiveness of the design makes it usable across different devices and screen sizes.

This project helped strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time data processing in JavaScript. It also enhanced my skills in creating practical web tools that combine functionality with a neat interface. Overall, the Temperature Converter project was a valuable experience that improved my confidence in front-end development and problem-solving using web technologies.
